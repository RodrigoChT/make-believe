# Summary by Booleandry
We started our adventure in the Brandonsford, a small town surrounded by tall stone walls. After enjoying a few ales at the Clumsy Fox, we learned that there is a monster keeping the town at bay. Shouts of dragons, giant worms, and lizards were heard. Nobody knew what exactly this monster was, but one had seen it, George, the redhead hunter. We learned from him that the creature has scales and drags its body on the ground. It's lair seems to be awfully close to the *X* in our treasure map. Unlucky. After hearing George's traumatic experience, Booleandry promised to defeat the monster. Before heading to the unknown, we visited Warwick, the smithy. The superstitious owner was quite a character, he believed that fairies were after him. After further inspection, the charismatic Sloms realized that, instead, it was Ingrid, the town's potion maker, who was after him, with intense passion and desire. We visited Ingrid afterwards. Although we did not enquire much about the relationship, I have a feeling that we will help cupido in the future. 

The next day, we started the search of the pirate map's bounty. We followed the river to the north. A group of pixies where enjoying a nice morning in the stream. After a nice couple trades, we earned 600 coins at the expense of some glue and a helmet. Awesome. Next, in our search of a way to cross the river, we learned that it's not a good idea to poke a wet log twice. Specially when you hear it rumbling. Even worse to stand in front of it and say "Hello". We fought the river troll. Bolo helped Booleandry dodge some blows. But it was too much for us. By the end, Sloms was badly hurt and strong Sleeps broke his only ranged weapon. We licked our wounds, collected broken pieces of weapons and headed back to town. We may have not been successful this time. But we lived to tell the tale. We will try again tomorrow.
