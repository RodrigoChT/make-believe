# Old School Renaissance
TheÂ Old School Renaissance, orÂ OSR, is a style of play that draws inspiration from the early days of D&D. To understand the differences between an OSR game and D&D 5e check out the [[Principia Apocrypha - Rules for Players.pdf|Old School Principles for Players]].
# The Rules
Knave 2e will be the **basis** of our rules system. It's an OSR compatible, classless, and light  system.
