# Companions
Statistics vary.

Companions are generated like a PC, do not make morale checks, and will fight to the death for their employer. They take a half share of any treasure and XP found and can gain levels over time. They will only follow PCs of a higher level. A PC’s CHA sets the maximum number of companions that will follow the PC over the course of their life.
