# One window to rule them all
During the session. players should only use Zoom, preferably on full screen mode. This means:

- Physical character sheets
- Physical dice
- No looking up "rules"
# The power of voice
Have a decent microphone ready for the session. 

(Jente is the only one lacking in this regard, shitty earbuds don't count)
# The time that is given to us
If you have to leave at a certain time, let everyone know 30 minutes beforehand. This will allow us to wrap up the session and hold the Council.
# The Council
At the end of every session we will hold the Council to discuss the following:
- What we liked and disliked
- Air grievances on rulings
- Decide the general direction the party is taking for next session
# The World is changing
Rules, precedent, and systems are not the boss of us. If we want to try new mechanics, change existing ones, or flip the whole system on its head we should do it. Bring you ideas to the Council.
